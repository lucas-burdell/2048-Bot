# 2048-Bot
## About This Project
This is my attempt at making AI that play the game 2048. The idea is to add several AI together to play the game in a cooperative fashion that outperforms each individually. This is meant to be an exploration of artificial intelligence methodologies. This is also my senior seminar, which is an overall evaluation of my education as an undergraduate.

## How to Use
While the AI are not set up to co-operate yet, you can still play with what AI I have individually here: https://lucas-burdell.github.io/2048-Bot/
